# This file contains random TODOs and some ideas for vproc

* The username and PID row are hard coded to hold 7 bytes each which
should be sufficient for most use cases but it would be better to
determine this dynamically.

* FIX: the state row is hard coded to hold 13 bytes. I haven't found
any man pages that suggest that states that are longer than 13 bytes
exist, but we should still check this.

* add functionality that lets the user send various notes (proc(3))
to the process. Perhaps by clicking on the PID a new menu will open?

* optimize the row spacing when the window is bigger than 80
characters wide, we are currently just wasting the rest of the
windows space if the arguments flag isn't set.

* be able to hide rows
